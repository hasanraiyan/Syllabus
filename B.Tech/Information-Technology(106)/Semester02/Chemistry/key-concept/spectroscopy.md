Spectroscopy is a scientific technique used to study the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. It involves analyzing the spectrum of light (or other types of electromagnetic radiation) emitted, absorbed, or scattered by materials. The resulting spectrum provides detailed information about the material's composition, structure, and physical properties.

### Key Concepts in Spectroscopy:
1. **Spectrum**: The range of different wavelengths (or frequencies) of light that are emitted or absorbed by a material.
  
2. **Electromagnetic Radiation**: Includes a wide range of wavelengths, from gamma rays and X-rays to visible light and radio waves.

3. **Interaction with Matter**: When electromagnetic radiation interacts with a material, it can be absorbed, emitted, or scattered, causing changes in the material's energy levels.

4. **Types of Spectroscopy**:
   - **Absorption Spectroscopy**: Measures the wavelengths of light absorbed by a sample.
   - **Emission Spectroscopy**: Analyzes the light emitted by a sample.
   - **Fluorescence Spectroscopy**: Studies the light emitted by a material after it has absorbed light.
   - **Raman Spectroscopy**: Measures the scattering of light to provide information about molecular vibrations.

5. **Applications**: Spectroscopy is widely used in chemistry, physics, astronomy, and biology to identify substances, analyze chemical compositions, study molecular structures, and even determine the properties of distant stars and galaxies.
