### Lecture Notes on Computers

#### 1.1 Computer
- **Definition:** An electronic device that accepts data from external sources (standard input devices), processes it at high speed according to given instructions, and can store large amounts of data. It is also known as a data processor because it can store, process, and retrieve data as needed.

- **Components of a Computer System:**
  1. **Hardware:** The physical components of a computer.
  2. **Software:** The programs and applications that run on a computer.
  3. **Instructions/Procedures/Modules:** The set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform tasks.
  4. **Data/Information:** The raw material (data) that is processed into meaningful form (information).
  5. **Communication:** The transfer of data between computers or devices.
  6. **People:** The users who interact with the computer system.

- **Functioning:** A computer cannot work on its own; it operates based on prior instructions, known as computer programming. It follows a series of instructions programmed into its memory by the user.

#### 1.2 Computer System Characteristics or Functions
1. **Speed and Accuracy:**
   - **Speed:** Computers operate at high speeds, measured in clock cycles (Hertz, Hz), often in GHz for modern desktops.
   - **Accuracy:** Computers execute instructions accurately, with errors typically arising from incorrect input data or unreliable procedures, often referred to as "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO).

2. **Diligence and Maintenance:**
   - Computers can work tirelessly 24/7, free from monotony and lack of concentration, making them ideal for repetitive tasks.

3. **Vast Storage Media:**
   - Computers can store and process vast amounts of information in a compact space, breaking it into a form they can understand and processing it into more intelligible data.

4. **Time Factor:**
   - Computers significantly reduce response time and the time spent on decision-making activities, with most instructions carried out in fractions of a second.

5. **Permanence and Versatility:**
   - Computers can store a large amount of data permanently and can perform various tasks through a finite series of logical steps.

### Basic Block Diagram and Function of a Computer System

A computer system can be broken down into several key components, each serving a specific function. The basic block diagram of a computer system typically includes the following main parts:

#### 1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions and processing data. It consists of three main components:

   - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**
     The ALU performs all arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) operations. It is a critical component in decision-making processes and data manipulation.

   - **Control Unit (CU):**
     The CU manages and coordinates all activities within the computer system. It interprets instructions from the software and directs other components of the system to perform specific tasks. It also regulates the timing and execution of instructions.

   - **Registers:**
     Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU that temporarily hold data and instructions being processed. They are crucial for quick data retrieval and manipulation.


#### 2. **Memory Unit**
The memory unit stores data and instructions that the CPU needs for processing. It is divided into two main types:

   - **Primary Memory (Main Memory):**
     This includes **RAM (Random Access Memory)** and **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**. RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its content when the computer is turned off. It is used for temporary storage and fast access by the CPU. ROM, on the other hand, is non-volatile and stores firmware, which is essential for booting up the system.

   - **Secondary Memory:**
     This includes storage devices like hard drives, SSDs (Solid State Drives), CDs, DVDs, and USB drives. It provides long-term storage for data and applications, retaining information even when the computer is turned off.



#### 3. **Input Unit**
The input unit comprises devices that take data and instructions from the user or other systems. Common input devices include keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones. These devices convert user inputs into a form that the computer can understand and process.

#### 4. **Output Unit**
The output unit consists of devices that convey the processed data from the computer to the user or other systems. Output devices include monitors, printers, speakers, and projectors. They translate the computer's results into a human-readable form.

#### 5. **Storage Unit**
The storage unit, both primary and secondary, is responsible for saving data and instructions. It includes volatile memory (RAM) for temporary storage and non-volatile memory (hard drives, SSDs) for permanent storage.

#### 6. **Communication Unit**
The communication unit manages the transmission of data and instructions between different parts of the computer or between computers over a network. This includes network cards, modems, and other communication interfaces.
