# Doped Semiconductor Calculation

## Question:

**1.a) A doped semiconductor has 10 billion silicon atoms and 15 million pentavalent atoms. If the ambient temperature is 25°C, how many free electrons are there inside the semiconductor?**

### Solution:

To find the number of free electrons in the doped semiconductor, consider the following:

1. **Number of Dopant Atoms:** The dopant atoms in this case are pentavalent, meaning each dopant atom contributes one free electron. We have 15 million (15 x 10^6) pentavalent atoms.

2. **Thermal Excitation:** At ambient temperature (25°C or 298 K), some electrons from the valence band can be thermally excited into the conduction band. However, in a heavily doped semiconductor like this one, the contribution of the dopant atoms to the number of free electrons generally outweighs the thermal excitation effects.

Given the heavy doping (15 million dopant atoms compared to 10 billion silicon atoms), the number of free electrons contributed by the pentavalent dopants will dominate.

**Total Number of Free Electrons:**

Since each pentavalent dopant atom contributes one free electron, the number of free electrons is approximately equal to the number of pentavalent dopant atoms.

Therefore, the number of free electrons in the semiconductor is:

**15 million = 15 x 10^6 free electrons**

## Question:

**1.b) Define direct band and indirect band semiconductor.**

### Solution:

**Direct Band Gap Semiconductor:**

In a direct band gap semiconductor, the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band occur at the same value of electron momentum. This alignment allows for efficient transitions of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, which is crucial for applications requiring light emission or absorption. As a result, direct band gap semiconductors are widely used in optical devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and semiconductor lasers.

**Example:**
- **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs):** GaAs is a common direct band gap semiconductor used in applications like LEDs and laser diodes because of its efficient light emission properties.

**Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor:**

In an indirect band gap semiconductor, the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band occur at different values of electron momentum. Consequently, transitioning an electron from the valence band to the conduction band requires additional interactions with a phonon (a lattice vibration) to adjust the electron’s momentum. This makes the process less efficient compared to direct band gap semiconductors. Indirect band gap semiconductors are commonly used in electronic devices where optical efficiency is less critical, such as in silicon-based electronics.

**Example:**
- **Silicon (Si):** Silicon is a widely used indirect band gap semiconductor, essential in electronic devices like transistors and integrated circuits.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the Fermi level in semiconductors, using the provided context and including relevant images:

# Fermi Level in Semiconductors

## Definition of Fermi Level

In semiconductors, the Fermi level is a crucial concept that provides insights into the distribution of electrons and holes. It is defined as the reference energy level at which the probability of occupancy by electrons is 50%. Essentially, the Fermi level gives us an idea about the probability of electron occupancy in the conduction band and the probability of hole presence in the valence band. It can also be viewed as the energy level corresponding to the center of gravity of the distribution of electrons and holes in a semiconductor, weighted by their respective energies.

## Fermi Level in Intrinsic Semiconductors

In intrinsic (pure) semiconductors, the Fermi level is located approximately at the center of the forbidden band (band gap). This positioning indicates that the concentration of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the concentration of holes in the valence band. In other words, the semiconductor is in equilibrium with equal numbers of free electrons and holes.

## Fermi Level in Extrinsic Semiconductors

The position of the Fermi level in extrinsic semiconductors (doped semiconductors) is influenced by the type and level of doping as well as the temperature.

### n-Type Semiconductor

In an n-type semiconductor, where the concentration of free electrons in the conduction band is higher than the concentration of holes in the valence band, the Fermi level shifts towards the conduction band. 

- **At 0 K:** The Fermi level lies between the conduction band energy \(E_C\) and the donor energy level \(E_D\). 

- **At T > 0 K:** As temperature increases, the concentration of electrons and holes changes, causing the Fermi level to shift. However, it remains above the center of the forbidden gap but can shift below the donor level with higher temperatures.

### p-Type Semiconductor

In a p-type semiconductor, where the concentration of holes in the valence band is higher than the concentration of electrons in the conduction band, the Fermi level shifts towards the valence band.

- **At 0 K:** The Fermi level is positioned between the valence band energy \(E_V\) and the acceptor energy level \(E_A\).

- **At T > 0 K:** With increasing temperature, the concentration of electrons and holes changes, causing the Fermi level to shift. It can move above the acceptor level but will always be below the center of the forbidden gap.
