**Question:**

A doped semiconductor has 10 billion silicon atoms and 15 million pentavalent atoms. If the ambient temperature is 25°C, how many free electrons are there inside the semiconductor?

**Answer:**

To find the number of free electrons:

1. **Number of dopant atoms**: Each pentavalent dopant atom contributes one free electron. There are 15 million (15 x 10^6) pentavalent atoms.

2. **Thermal excitation**: At 25°C (298 K), the contribution from the dopant atoms is usually more significant than thermal excitation in a heavily doped semiconductor.

Thus, the number of free electrons is approximately equal to the number of pentavalent dopant atoms.

**Total number of free electrons:**

\[ 15 \text{ million} = 15 \times 10^6 \text{ free electrons} \]
