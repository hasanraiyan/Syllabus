### 1. Definition and Examples of Probability Spaces
- **Probability Space**: A mathematical framework for representing experiments with uncertain outcomes. It consists of three components: a sample space, a set of events, and a probability measure.
  - **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
    - Example: For a coin toss, the sample space is {Heads, Tails}.
  - **Event**: A subset of the sample space. It represents outcomes of interest.
    - Example: In a dice roll, an event could be rolling an even number, which includes {2, 4, 6}.
  - **Probability Measure (P)**: A function that assigns a probability to each event in the sample space, adhering to certain axioms (e.g., \( 0 \leq P(A) \leq 1 \) for any event \( A \), and \( P(S) = 1 \)).

### 2. Sample Spaces, Events, and Probability Measures
- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  - Discrete sample space: Contains a countable number of outcomes.
    - Example: Rolling a six-sided die, \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).
  - Continuous sample space: Contains an uncountable number of outcomes.
    - Example: The possible values of time it takes for a computer to boot up, which could be any non-negative real number.
- **Events**:
  - Simple event: An event consisting of a single outcome.
    - Example: Rolling a 3 on a die.
  - Compound event: An event consisting of multiple outcomes.
    - Example: Rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6).
- **Probability Measure**:
  - For discrete sample spaces, the probability measure assigns probabilities to individual outcomes such that the sum of all probabilities is 1.
    - Example: In a fair die roll, \( P(\{1\}) = \frac{1}{6}, P(\{2\}) = \frac{1}{6}, \ldots, P(\{6\}) = \frac{1}{6} \).
  - For continuous sample spaces, the probability measure often involves a probability density function (PDF).

### 3. Axioms of Probability
- **Non-negativity**: For any event \( A \), \( P(A) \geq 0 \).
- **Normalization**: The probability of the sample space is 1, i.e., \( P(S) = 1 \).
- **Additivity**: For any two mutually exclusive events \( A \) and \( B \) (i.e., \( A \cap B = \emptyset \)), \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \).
  - Generalized form (Countable additivity): For a countable sequence of mutually exclusive events \( A_1, A_2, \ldots \), \( P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i) \).

### Suggested Readings and Practice
- **Textbook**: A good introductory textbook on probability theory, such as "A First Course in Probability" by Sheldon Ross.
- **Practice Problems**:
  - Identify and describe the sample space for various experiments (e.g., flipping coins, rolling dice, drawing cards).
  - Define events and assign probabilities to them in simple experiments.
  - Verify that a given probability measure satisfies the axioms of probability.

By studying these topics, you'll be well-prepared for understanding probability spaces and their foundational role in probability theory.
